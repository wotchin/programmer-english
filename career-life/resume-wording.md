### Usage Guidance

1. **Be Specific**: For each verb, tie it to a quantifiable result when possible (e.g., "Increased sales by 25%").
2. **Highlight Action and Impact**: Choose verbs that convey both what you did and the result. For example, "Streamlined reporting procedures, saving time" combines action (streamlined) and impact (saved time).
3. **Match Tone with Role**: Use verbs that fit the level of responsibility. For leadership roles, choose stronger words like "directed" or "presided"; for support roles, "assisted" or "helped" may be more appropriate.
4. **Be Clear and Concise**: Avoid overusing complex words that might confuse readers. If a simpler word (like "helped" instead of "facilitated") is appropriate, it can sometimes be more effective.
5. **Focus on Results**: Tailor sentences to show not just the tasks you completed but the positive outcome.
